# CodeGradX

This is a new version of the CodeGradX library, a JavaScript library to interact with the CodeGradX infrastructure. 
The CodeGradX infrastructure provides mechanically grading facilities: 
- students may submit answers to programming exercises, 
- authors may submit new programming exercises, 
- teachers may monitor the progress of their students.

The library uses WebModules and Promises. WebModules are dynamically loaded whenever imported thus lessening 
the size of the core library. Contrarily to the previous libraries such as 
https://github.com/ChristianQueinnec/CodeGradXlib, the present library can only be operated on the browser side.
